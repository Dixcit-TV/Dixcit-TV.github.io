	<h3 class="tm-text-shadow">Introduction</h2>
	<p class="mb-5">In the second semester of our second year, we are being randomly assigned into <b>groups of 4 to 6 people</b> with our collegue from the Game Graphics and Production major (artists) to have a first hands-on experience in creating a vertical slice of a game as a team, following an <b>agile project management process.</b> During our year, the theme of the games was <b>Arcades</b>.<br/>
	We spend a couple of weeks brainstorming and prototyping game ideas, then create the necessary technical and artistic documents and build our agile backlog and sprint boards. The projects lasts for <b>2 production sprints of 3 weeks and 1 polish sprint of 2 weeks</b> with weekly meetings with our teacher coordinators. We are each working <b>10hrs per week</b>.</p>
	
	<h3 class="tm-text-shadow">The Team and the Game</h3>
	
	<p class="mb-5">My group was constituted of <b>3 artists and 2 programmers</b> (including myself). After going through several ideas and weighted the pros and cons, and the feasability in the allocated time, we settled for a <b>3D dodging game based</b> in a Viking setup where a viking warrior <b>dodges the kitchen items, food and weapons</b> thrown by his angry wife. The goal of the game being to <b/>last as long as possible in an increasigly fast</b> game while <b>dodging damaging and harmful items and collecting life and buffing beers</b>.<br/>
	The player has 5 lifes, each red highlighted items remove 1 life upon impact.<br/>
	The purple items are active debufs that will slow the player or impair their movements.<br/>
	Finally the gree items are beneficial items which will restore the player's health or provide him with a gauge that can be activated to cleanse debufs and become invincible.</p>
	
	<h3 class="tm-text-shadow">My role within the team</h3>
	
	<p class="mb-5">When we settled for our game idea, I've been involved in prototyping the camera behaviors and player movements withing the rounded arena. We needed to define a way for the camera to transition smoothly and confortably left and right when the player moves around. Also it was import that moving sideways meant that the character would properly follow the arena curvature.<br/>
	We then prototyped and few objects and how we would handle the impacts.</b>
	I was also involved in creating the <b>Tech Document</b> and setting up our <b>Perforce</b> structure.</p>
	
	<p class="mb-5">During production, I was assigned various tasks project wide. From finishing the implementation of the movement and camera setup and creating the <b>buff/debuff system</b> allowing stacking, cleansing and invincibility, to setting up the <b>boss character's animation finite state machine to plug-in animations and states</b> or preparing the <b>UI flow and logic</b> for it to be ready for its design.<br/>
	A lot of play-testing was needed to balance the throw rate and mechanics of the items and ensure that the whole setup feels fun and confortable for the players. Each members of the team was pushed to try out the game for a short perio of time and regularly to give their feedback and opinions.</p>
	
	<p class="mb-5">Polish was spent on finishing balancing the game all together, add the logic to handle sounds, music and particle effects and making sure everything is in order for the release.</p>
	
	<p class="mb-5">Aside from the purely programming aspect of the project, I was in charge of <b>merging our stable developement branch in our main branch</b> and was also available for our artists to help out with technical questions around Unity and Perforce.</p>
