	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	<p class="mb-5">As 3rd year DAE students, we grouped up to experience (once again) working as a Game Development team. Most projects are pitched by companies and we can "apply" to participate in out preferred one, but we also had the opportunity to pitch our project. That is what we, Team Full Rebuild, did. We then spent 10 weeks (~30h/week) of our autumn semester prototyping, implementing and polishing our idea... Titan's Tribute was born.</p>
