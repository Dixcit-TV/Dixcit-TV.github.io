	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	<p class="mb-5">As 3rd year DAE students, we grouped up to experience (once again) working as a Game Development team. Most projects are pitched by companies and we can "apply" to participate in out preferred one, but we also had the opportunity to pitch our project. That is what we, Team Full Rebuild, did. We then spent 10 weeks (~30h/week) of our autumn semester prototyping, implementing and polishing our idea... Titan's Tribute was born.</p>
	
	<h3>Meet the Team and the Game</h3>
	
	<p class="mb-5">Our team, Full Rebuild, was composed of 3 artists (1 character artis, 1 environement artist and 1 VFX/Rigging/Animation artist) and 3 programmers, including myself. In terms of programmers, we didn't have any specialization set on paper when starting the project. We distributed the according to preferences and then related tasks logically.<br/><br/>
	The game, Titan's tribute, is a third person (over the shoulder) splitscreen PvP PC game in which two players duel against one another in an enclosed arena. Before each game, each player customize their Titan by selecting 2 arm abilities (right & left), 1 core ability and 1 leg ability from a predefined list. All abilities are divided amongst 3 different elements: fire, ice and nature. Once each player have locked their build, they are summoned into the arena in a 3-life fight to the death using their preferred skills combined with base melee attacks.<br/>
	Our vision for the game was to provide the players with the ability to take ownership or their fighter and create a playstyle that suits them most. Titan's Tribute is meant to allow the players to show their mastery and skills and challenge them against their friends. The game can be played with mouse and keyboard as well as controllers.</p>
	
	<h3>My role within the team</h3>
	
	<p class="mb-5">As mentionned before, us programmers were not tighly attached to different areas of the code and were taking on tasks on a need to basis, according to our current sprint schedule and wish list.<br/><br/>
	Prototyping phase:<br/><br/>
	I took on several hats. My main task at this point was to prototype the game's "Training Ground". In our base vision of the game, due to the significant number of skill combinations, we wanted to integrate a training ground in which the player could test out their skills against a lowly to moderatly smart AI. I then had to do some research on similar AIs for existing game as well as implementing a barebone version in UE4 as proof of concept. We agreed on a training ground similar to Smash Bros in which the AIs have a fixed set of behaviors that can be individually selected and they keep repeating that behavior. While prototyping showed that it could have relatively good results, we started reaching the end of the prototyping phase and it became apparent that implementing a fairly complete and interesting training ground would be a large endeavor which would take me away from the rest of the project altogether. With the large amount of abilities and gameplay feature needed by the core of the game (the PvP), it was not something we could afford and the training ground was then scrapped.<br/><br/>
	At the same time, I volunteered to write the Technical (Overall game presentation, target audience and platform, technology and software used, etc...) and finalize the Game Design document (descriptiong of all the game systems we are targeting).<br/><br/>
	Prototyping phase:<br/><br/>
	During the production phase, I first took on adding the spliscreen support for the game. It implied handling mouse keyboard + controller as well as 2 controllers with proper handling of controller (dis-)connection, handle in game pause menu (only player who pause can control the menu), in-game HUD logic, as well as end game screen.<br/>
	I was also responsible in implementing player (re-)spawning, player death (from damage or out-of-map) notifications, implementing abilities (i.e. explosive seedling, homing ice-shard, poison dart, ...) and related bug fixing or simply some support of features that were not quite there.<br/><br/><p>
