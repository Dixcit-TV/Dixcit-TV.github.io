	<h3 class="tm-text-shadow">Introduction</h2>
	<p class="mb-5">Although it is a school project, it was a great experience to have a more guided and in-depth take on developing my own Raytracer. It also grew my interest in Graphics programming (as did all the projects I worked on that subject later on).</p>
	
	<p class="mb-5">On a side note, over the summer between my first and second year at Digital Art and Entertainment, I decided to work on my own Raytracer as a side project. I knew my first graphics programming was coming up and working with a raytracer was something that was thrown at me by comapnies during job applications. It wasn't glorious back then (although my lack of C++ knowledge was also an issue) so I wanted to take my revenge.</p>
	
	<p class="mb-5">So it technically is my second raytracer but this one is more full and interesting so it should get the most credits.</p>
	
	<h3 class="tm-text-shadow">What does it do?</h2>
	
	<p>The raytracer has some basic features you would expect:	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sphere & Plane intersection.</li>
		<li>OBJ file loading (removes duplicate vertices).</li>
		<li>Triangle meshes intersection.</li>
		<li>Point & Directional lights.</li>
		<li>Hard shadows</li>
		<li>Lambert, Phong BRDFs</li>
		<li>Cook-Torrance PBR BRDF</li>
		<li>Front-, Back- & No-Culling modes</li>
		<li>Dynamic right-handed camera (UE4-like controls)</li>
		<li>Quaternion-based camera rotations</li>
	</ul>
